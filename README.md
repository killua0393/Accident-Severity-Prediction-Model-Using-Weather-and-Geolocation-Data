# 🚦 Accident Severity Prediction Model Using Weather and Geolocation Data

This project predicts the severity of road accidents based on historical accident data, weather conditions, and geolocation insights. It aims to help authorities and developers build smarter, safer road systems using machine learning and real-world data sources.

## 📊 Features

- Weather-integrated prediction model
- Geolocation and time-based severity analysis
- Data pre-processing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive visualization (optional with app.py or dashboard)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Flask (for the app)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo (excluding the zip):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/killua0393/Accident-Severity-Prediction-Model-Using-Weather-and-Geolocation-Data.git
   ```

2. Download the full project with models and datasets from the link below ⬇️

3. Extract the zip and navigate to the project folder.

4. Create a virtual environment and install requirements:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
